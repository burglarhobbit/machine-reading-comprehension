This example shows how you can define your own custom forms by using form rendering rules. It also demonstrates general file handling as well as the handling of image files specifically.


To run this example:

1. Clone the repository::

    git clone https://github.com/mrjoes/flask-admin.git
    cd flask-admin

2. Create and activate a virtual environment::

    virtualenv env
    source env/bin/activate

3. Install requirements::

    pip install -r 'examples/forms/requirements.txt'

4. Run the application::

    python examples/forms/app.py

The first time you run this example, a sample sqlite database gets populated automatically. To suppress this behaviour,
comment the following lines in app.py:::

    if not os.path.exists(database_path):
        build_sample_db()
