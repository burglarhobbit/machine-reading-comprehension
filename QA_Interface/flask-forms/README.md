# Flask Forms

This is a very basic Flask application using two routes and an interactive form. It illustrates how to use [Flask-WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Flask-Bootstrap](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Bootstrap/index.html) in a Flask app.

The code is explained in [this slide deck](http://bit.ly/mm-flask-webforms-slides).

A first version of the app is in **actors.py**. To run it, it is assumed that you:

1. Are using Python 3.x.

2. Have already installed Flask and its dependencies.

3. Have activated your virtualenv (if you are using one).

Run the app by entering its folder in Terminal and typing:

`$ python actors.py`

Then open your web browser and type this in the address bar:

`localhost:5000/`

## More functionality

A second version of the app is in **actors_2.py**.

Run the app by entering its folder in Terminal and typing:

`$ python actors_2.py`

Then open your web browser and type this in the address bar:

`localhost:5000/`

Note that if the Flask web server was already running before this, you'll need to stop it by pressing Control-C in Terminal before you run **actors_2.py**.
