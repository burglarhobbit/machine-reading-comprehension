# Flask Example files

This small repo is incomplete and intended for use in a [hands-on tutorial](http://bit.ly/mm-flask2-slides).

It is assumed that you:

1. Are using Python 3.x.

2. Have already installed Flask and its dependencies.

3. Have activated your virtualenv (if you are using one).

Run the app by entering its folder in Terminal and typing:

`$ python students.py`

Then open your web browser and type this in the address bar:

`localhost:5000/`
